# Summer ML
Here is a central repo for some fun small ML projects. Please feel free to add onto this list or invite more people. The more the merrier :)
Everyone can certainly do their own things, but rough goal was have a project or a model that we work on for a bit of time (groups, solo, not at all, who cares) and then maybe present / conviene at the end for a cool coffee chat. Like book club, but for coding ML stuff.

## Goals
The goal is to mess around with some fun ML projects and different kinds of models.
I have not seen a wide variety, so want to get some good exposure to new methods.
This will be lots of playing around with libraries and just messing around seeing what is possible.
Projects should be short (~2 weeks) and fun. It doesn't matter if it is that serious or even if it works. 

## Backgrounds
- Elliott has done significant work around Neural Networks and NLP
- Hunter has done significant work around Tree-Based Modeling and classification problems.

## Models/Techniques
Some different models/methods I want to try out
- Neural Networks
    - Feed-Forward Networks
    - GA / NEAT
        - GA that evolves NN structure as well. [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBullet) uses this a bit
    - GAN
        - looks fun
    - Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN)
        - RNN, LSTM
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
        - I've done some with these, so maybe less interested?
    - NLP
        - transformers = fun
        - Google Universal Sentence Encoder
    - [SAINT](https://github.com/somepago/saint)
- Survival Analysis
    - XGBoost
    - Cox Proprotional Hazards
    - Kaplan Meier
    - Exponential
    - Weibull
- Clustering Techniques
    - Heirarchical Clustering
        - HDBSCAN
    - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
- Artificial Intelligence
    - HMM
    - Q-Learning
    - Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
- Other models that are always fun
    - PSO
    - Bayes Net
    - SVM (kernel functions)
- Ensemble Methods
    - Random Forest
    - Adaboost 
    - XGBoost 
    - CatBoost 
    - LightGBM
    - [Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)](https://interpret.ml/docs/ebm.html)
- Feature Selection
    - Boruta
- Explanability
    - SHAP
    - LIME
- [Topological Data Analysis (TDA)](ayasdi.com)
- Dataset Rebalancing
    - Synthetic Data Creation
        - SMOTE
    - Over/Undersampling
- Probability Calibration
    - Platt Scaling
    - Isotonic Regression

## Project Ideas
Different ideas. Should be fun, and (hopefully) not just following tutorial using a standard dataset.
NO MNIST, iris, CIFAR, etc. 

- City Name Generator
- Loan Default/Early Payment prediction
- Fraud detection
- Property valuation
- OCR model
- Color palate picker
- Different game AIs
    - Monopoly
    - Tetris (Codebullet did this.)
    - Risk
    - Card games like Hearts/Hand and Foot?
- Stock market?
    - A bit too basic/common
    - Also, really effing hard. (Don't predict price, predict volatility)
    - Consider using related articles to a company to determine price shock?
    - See Efficient Market Hypothesis
    - Maybe Buy/Sell recommendations + Data curation?
- Fantasy football draft 
    - Weather plays a major role
- Determine if an image has a rubber duck in it (Object detection)
- Recommender system
- Simulation like WorldBox
