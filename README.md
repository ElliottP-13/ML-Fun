# Summer ML
## Goals
The goal is to mess around with some fun ML projects and different kinds of models.
I have not seen a wide variety, so want to get some good exposure to new methods.
This will be lots of playing around with libraries and just messing around seeing what is possible.
Projects should be short (~2 weeks) and fun. It doesn't matter if it is that serious or even if it works. 

## Models
Some different models/methods I want to try out

- GA / NEAT
    - GA that evolves NN structure as well. [Code Bullet](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBullet) uses this a bit
- GAN
    - looks fun
- Recurrent Neural Nets
    - RNN, LSTM
- Conv Nets
    - I've done some with these, so maybe less interested?
- Ensemble Methods
    - Random Forest
    - Adaboost / XG Boost
- NLP
    - transformers = fun
- Other models that are always fun
    - PSO
    - Bayes Net
    - SVM (kernel functions)
    - HMM

## Project Ideas
Different ideas. Should be fun, and (hopefully) not just following tutorial using a standard dataset.
NO MNIST, iris, CIFAR, etc. 

- Tabular something another
- Color palate picker
- Different game AIs
- Stock market?
    - a bit too basic/common
- Fantasy football draft
